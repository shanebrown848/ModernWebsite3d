This is just a template, where I am starting to implement 3d images to add some "wow" factor to it.
All though this version is just basic, but it does have a link to my portfolio website which I also did from scratch.
I am just utlilizing git and learning how to push. I am thinking about using the github pages to help showcase my templates.
Check it out. I am a newer developer, and always eager to learn. Lets collaborate on something.
